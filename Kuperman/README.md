# CryptoGraph
CryptoGraph - is an app to observe the most popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Etherium. CryptoGraph is taking info from 
the 3 markets(Bitstamp, Bitfinex and CEX) and building a graph that shows asks, bids and last prices of the cryptocurrencies from the 
each market. 
To create this app I used this list of modules:
<ul>
<li>Alamofire - to work with markets' API</li>
<li>DropDown - to create a drop down list with which the user can choose which crypto and from which market he wants to observe the graph</li>
<li>SwiftyJSON - to parse JSON requests into Swift</li>
<li>Charts - to draw the graph</li>
</ul>
